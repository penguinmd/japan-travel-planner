# Session Notes - October 19, 2025

## Session Overview
This session focused on adding city overview map functionality for the General Tips and Trains tabs, with numbered indicators in the navigation tabs.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. City Overview Map Implementation
**Goal**: Add map pins for each city mentioned in General Tips and Trains tabs

**Changes Made**:
- Created `overviewCities` array in `maps.js` with coordinates for 5 main cities:
  - Tokyo (1)
  - Kyoto (2)
  - Osaka (3)
  - Kinosaki (4)
  - Kanazawa (5)

- Implemented `showOverviewMap()` function in `maps.js`:
  - Displays all 5 cities with gold numbered markers (40px diameter)
  - Animates map to show full Japan overview
  - Shows tooltips with city names on hover
  - Fits bounds to display all cities nicely with zoom level 7

- Updated `updateMapForSection()` in `index.html`:
  - Detects when "tips" or "trains" sections are active
  - Calls `showOverviewMap()` for these sections
  - Shows "Japan Cities" title and "5 cities to explore" subtitle

**Files Modified**:
- `maps.js`: Added overviewCities data and showOverviewMap() function
- `index.html`: Updated updateMapForSection() logic

### 2. Numbered City Tabs
**Goal**: Show city numbers (1-5) directly in the navigation tab buttons

**Changes Made**:
- Added `<span class="city-number">X</span>` to each city tab button
- Created CSS styling for `.city-number`:
  - Gold circular badges (22px diameter)
  - White text, bold font
  - 8px margin-right for spacing
  - Inverts to white background with gold text when tab is active

**Visual Design**:
- Inactive tab: Gold circle with white number
- Active tab: White circle with gold number (matches accent color)

**Files Modified**:
- `index.html`: Added city-number spans to Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Kinosaki, Kanazawa buttons
- `styles.css`: Added .city-number and .nav-btn.active .city-number styles

### 3. Bug Fixes

#### Bug: Overview Map Not Showing on Page Load
**Issue**: When page loaded with General Tips active, no map pins were displayed

**Root Cause**: No map initialization call for the default active section on page load

**Fix**: Added `updateMapForSection('tips')` to DOMContentLoaded event handler

**Files Modified**: `index.html`

#### Bug: Redundant City Indicators
**Issue**: City indicator tiles were displayed in content area, duplicating the tab numbers

**Fix**: Removed the large city indicator tile sections from both General Tips and Trains content

**Files Modified**: `index.html`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Map Display Logic
```javascript
// When tips or trains sections are active:
if (sectionId === 'tips' || sectionId === 'trains') {
    mapTitle.textContent = 'Japan Cities';
    mapSubtitle.textContent = '5 cities to explore';
    showOverviewMap();
}
```

### City Number Styling
```css
.city-number {
    background: var(--accent-gold);
    color: white;
    width: 22px;
    height: 22px;
    border-radius: 50%;
    /* ... */
}

.nav-btn.active .city-number {
    background: white;
    color: var(--accent-gold);
}
```

### Overview Map Markers
- **Color**: Gold (`var(--accent-gold)`) to distinguish from location-specific pins
- **Size**: 40px diameter (larger than location pins which are 32px)
- **Numbers**: 1-5 matching the tab button numbers
- **Interactive**: Show city name tooltip on hover

## User Experience Flow

1. **Page Load**:
   - General Tips tab is active by default
   - Map shows overview with 5 numbered city pins
   - Tab buttons show numbered badges for cities

2. **Viewing Tips/Trains**:
   - Click General Tips or Trains tab
   - Map displays all 5 cities with gold numbered markers
   - Smooth animation transitions the map view

3. **Viewing Specific City**:
   - Click numbered city tab (e.g., "① Tokyo")
   - Map zooms into that city's specific locations
   - Shows detailed pins for attractions, hotels, restaurants

4. **Number Consistency**:
   - Tokyo = 1 (everywhere)
   - Kyoto = 2 (everywhere)
   - Osaka = 3 (everywhere)
   - Kinosaki = 4 (everywhere)
   - Kanazawa = 5 (everywhere)

- Filter checkboxes were added to toggle marker types
- Numbers were matched between HTML content and map pins
- Vercel deployment was configured
- Missing details from JAPAN.docx were added

## Known Issues / Future Enhancements

None identified at this time. All requested functionality has been implemented and tested.

## Deployment Status
